> ### Disclaimer
>* AdGuard for Mac is not an open source project. We use GitHub as an open bug tracker for users to see what developers are working on. However, we at AdGuard create [a lot of open source software](https://github.com/search?o=desc&q=topic%3Aopen-source+org%3AAdguardTeam+fork%3Atrue&s=stars&type=Repositories).
>* Privacy policy: https://adguard.com/privacy/mac.html (Briefly: AdGuard sends only necessary, limited information, e.g. information required for a license check).

AdGuard is the only standalone ad blocker app for Mac that can block ads equally well in all browsers and apps, not only in Safari. It will also protect your data from tracking and shield your privacy.
